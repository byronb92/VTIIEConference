VTIIEConference
===============

VTIIEConference is an iOS app that displays information about events and activities for the Spring 2014 Virginia Tech IIE Conference.

Things of Note.
1. The is the first app that I have created and published on the App Store. You can download it here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vt-iie-regional-spring-conference/id822858965?ls=1&mt=8
2. Most of the data (pictures/contact information) was stored statically. I wanted a portion of the app to be able to be accessed without network connectivity.
3. I forget to resize some of the images, which made the final app size 46 MB.
4. There is an abundant amount of code reuse here, and when I have the time I'll eventually reconsolidate everything to follow more object-oriented guidelines.
