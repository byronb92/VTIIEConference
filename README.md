VTIIEConference
===============

VTIIEConference is an iOS app that displays information about events and activities for the Spring 2014 Virginia Tech IIE Conference. The conference began on February 21st and ended on February 23rd.

Things of Note.

1. This app has been published on the App Store. You can download it here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vt-iie-regional-spring-conference/id822858965?ls=1&mt=8

2. Most of the data (pictures/contact information) was stored statically. I wanted a portion of the app to be able to be accessed without network connectivity.

3. I forget to resize some of the images, which made the final app size 46 MB. Not a huge issue, but it would've been nice to have the app more lightweight.



UPDATE: This app is no longer avaialble on the app store, since I no longer have an iOS developer license.
